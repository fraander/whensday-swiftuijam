# Whensday

Whensday is the all-in-one task list and planner. Mark both when tasks are due and when you want to do them so that you can stay organized! It works on iOS, iPadOS, and MacOS and features dark mode support.

## Privacy Policy
I don't store and cannot see the data you add as tasks. I can see some logs of what Xcode sends me, though these don't contain identifying information.
